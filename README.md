# 🏈 04_kaggleNFL_trajectory_prediction

This repository demonstrates how I approach a **Machine Learning project with structured CSV data** — from data exploration and feature engineering to model training and evaluation.  
As a real-world example, I participate in the **[NFL Big Data Bowl 2026 – Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2026-prediction/overview)** competition on Kaggle.
